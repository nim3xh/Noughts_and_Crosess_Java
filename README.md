## TicTacToe Game Design by using java

Naughts and Crosses, developed in NetBeans IDE, is a fully functional, user-friendly, and engaging 
strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. In addition to the classic two-player mode with "X" and "O" 
markers, the game offers a dynamic three-player mode featuring the symbols "X," "O," and "Z" on a 
4x4 grid. Players can take turns strategically placing their chosen symbols on the board, with the 
primary objective being to achieve three markers in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
In the three-player mode, participants aim to create winning combinations across the expanded grid, 
introducing an extra layer of complexity and excitement. The game employs Object-Oriented 
Programming (OOP) principles, making it an ideal introduction to programming concepts for 
beginners. The graphical user interface (GUI) is enhanced using the JTattoo library, providing an 
aesthetically pleasing and seamless gaming experience. Whether playing in the classic two-player 
setup or embracing the challenge of the three-player mode, Naughts and Crosses promises hours of 
strategic fun for players of all skill levels.
